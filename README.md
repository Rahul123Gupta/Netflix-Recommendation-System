🎬 Netflix Recommendation System

This project is a Data Science and Machine Learning based recommendation system inspired by Netflix. It suggests movies and TV shows to users based on their ratings, genres, and viewing preferences.

📖 About the Project

I created this project as part of my Data Science learning journey to understand how real-world recommendation systems work. The project focuses on analyzing user data, exploring patterns, and building a model that can recommend similar content intelligently.

🧠 Key Highlights

Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find insights from Netflix data

Developed a Content-Based Recommendation Engine using Cosine Similarity

Experimented with Collaborative Filtering techniques for better personalization

Visualized insights and recommendations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

The dataset includes Netflix movies and TV shows along with genres, ratings, and descriptions. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to make accurate recommendations.

🚀 Future Improvements

Implement Hybrid Recommendation System (content + collaborative)

Add a Streamlit web interface for interactive recommendations

Enhance accuracy using Deep Learning (Autoencoders / Neural CF)

💡 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
